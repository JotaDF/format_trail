Introduction
============
For a while now I have wanted to create a test suite that is automated.  Upon
realising that Moodle is starting to migrate Behat etc. I consider that this
is a good thing to do.  However, it is complicated.  Additionally the existing
tests are complicated too where they use PHPUnit.  I understand the principle
being close to JUnit but is a learning curve.  Therefore at the current moment
in time I'm going to concentrate on manual test plans and small semi-automated
bespoke unit tests as already started with 'test_image.php'.

This file contains a series of 'test plans' that are performed manually to
prove that the functionality operates correctly.  They are by no means complete.

I welcome any input / assistance in writing automated Behat etc. tests.  If you
wish to fork the project from https://github.com/gjb2048/moodle-courseformat_trail
then please do so, add tests and perform a 'pull' request to contribute to the
format.

Testing
=======
All the tests assume that you understand how to use Moodle functionality to
perform such things as enrolment and capability management.

Test preparation
================
Create a course and set it to the trail format.  Note down the 'course id'.  The
'id' part of the URL when viewing the course.

Test Plans
==========

Image
-----
This tests that the GD Library is installed, the image conversion code works and
then goes on to confirm that the image is converted for use and the displayed
version is created.

1. Whilst logged in, open a new tab / window and type:
   your moodle installation/course/format/trail/test/test_image.php?=courseid=X

   Where 'your moodle installation' is the start of the Moodle installation URL
   and 'X' is the course id from 'Test preparation'.
2. Observe that the converted image is smaller than the original.
3. Observe that the original image has been resized to the maximum for storage.
4. Observe that the resized original has been converted to a displayed version
   as per the current course settings which are shown.

Restore from a previous version
-------------------------------
1. With the supplied backup file:
   '/test/backup-moodle2-course-21-gt-20131104-1255-nu.mbz'.
2. Restore to a new course and confirm that you see the test image
   '515-797no09sa.jpg' in the second section being called '515-797no09sa'.

Backup / restore from the current version and reset to default
--------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Ensure you have run the 'Image' test with the course setup in
    'Test preparation' and that it contains at least one image.
2.  Change the course settings so that the image width, colours etc. are
    different to the defaults that were used when the course was created.
    The defaults can be seen under 'Site administration' -> 'Plugins' ->
    'Course formats' -> 'Trail format'.
3.  Backup the course.  Confirm you end up with a backup file.
4.  Restore the course to a new course in the same category.  Confirm that
    you have a new course with the same images and settings as you set in step
    '2'.
5.  Go to the course settings and then 'Trail reset options' and reset the 
    'Image container size' for the current course (not 'all'). Confirm that
    the image container size only resets to the defaults.
6.  Go to the course settings and then 'Trail reset options' and reset the 
    'Image resize method' for the current course (not 'all'). Confirm that
    the image resize method only resets to the default.
7.  Go to the course settings and then 'Trail reset options' and reset the 
    'Image container style' for the current course (not 'all'). Confirm that
    the image container style only resets to the default.
8.  Go back to the course you used to create the backup file and confirm that
    its settings are as they were when you backed up the course and not the
    defaults.
9.  Go back to the restored course and change the all of the settings randomly
    to your choice.
10. With the backed up course in another tab on the restored course go to the
    course settings and then 'Trail reset options' and reset the 
    'Image container sizes' for the all courses (the 'all'). Confirm that
    the image container size only resets to the defaults.  Refresh the backed up
    course and confirm the image container size only resets to the defaults.
11. On the restored course go to the course settings and then
    'Trail reset options' and reset the 'Image resize methods' for the all
    courses (the 'all'). Confirm that the image resize method only resets to the
    defaults.  Refresh the backed up course and confirm the image resize method
    only resets to the default.
12. On the restored course go to the course settings and then
    'Trail reset options' and reset the 'Image container styles' for the all
    courses (the 'all'). Confirm that the image container style only resets to
    the defaults.  Refresh the backed up course and confirm the image container
    style only resets to the defaults.
